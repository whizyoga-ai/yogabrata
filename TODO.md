# TODO: Implement Micropipelines and Smart Dependencies in CI/CD

## CI Micropipelines (Build Phase)
- [x] checkout-and-cache: Add job to checkout code and set up caching for dependencies
- [x] frontend-build: Add conditional job to build frontend Docker image only if frontend files changed
- [x] backend-build: Add conditional job to build backend Docker image only if backend files changed
- [x] infrastructure-build: Add conditional job to build infrastructure components if nginx.conf or docker-compose.yml changed

## CD Micropipelines (Deploy Phase)
- [x] frontend-deploy: Add job to deploy frontend service if frontend build succeeded
- [x] backend-deploy: Add job to deploy backend service if backend build succeeded
- [x] backup-micropipeline: Add job to create database and data backups before deployment
- [x] health-check-micropipeline: Add job to run health checks on deployed services and rollback if failed
- [x] infrastructure-deploy: Add job to deploy nginx and other infrastructure if infrastructure files changed

## Additional Tasks
- [ ] Update docker-compose.yml or create override files for production (no volume mounts)
- [x] Test pipeline on feature branches and main branch
- [ ] Measure build and deploy times before and after
- [ ] Document the new pipeline and deployment process

# Plan for Implementing Micropipelines and Smart Dependencies in Yogabrata AI Project CI/CD

## 1. Information Gathered

- Current CI/CD pipeline (.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml) only performs minimal validation and summary steps; no actual build or deploy automation.
- Frontend Dockerfile uses multi-stage builds with caching of node_modules and build artifacts.
- Backend Dockerfile uses caching of Python dependencies and source code.
- docker-compose.yml mounts source code as volumes for frontend and backend, which can cause rebuilds or restarts on every code change.
- Deployment is currently manual via `infrastructure/deploy-windows.bat`.
- No caching or conditional build/deploy steps in CI/CD pipeline.

## 2. Goals

- Implement micropipelines in CI/CD to build and deploy only changed components (frontend/backend).
- Use Docker layer caching and GitHub Actions cache to speed up builds.
- Use conditional execution in GitHub Actions jobs based on changed files.
- Automate deployment steps in CI/CD pipeline.
- Reduce build and deploy times for small changes.

## 3. Proposed Changes

### 3.1 CI/CD Pipeline (.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml)

#### CI Micropipelines (Build Phase):
- **checkout-and-cache**: Checkout code and set up caching for dependencies.
- **frontend-build**: Build frontend Docker image only if frontend files changed (conditional on paths: `frontend/**`).
- **backend-build**: Build backend Docker image only if backend files changed (conditional on paths: `backend/**`).
- **infrastructure-build**: Build infrastructure components if nginx.conf or docker-compose.yml changed.

#### CD Micropipelines (Deploy Phase):
- **frontend-deploy**: Deploy frontend service if frontend build succeeded.
- **backend-deploy**: Deploy backend service if backend build succeeded.
- **backup-micropipeline**: Create database and data backups before deployment.
- **health-check-micropipeline**: Run health checks on deployed services and rollback if failed.
- **infrastructure-deploy**: Deploy nginx and other infrastructure if infrastructure files changed.

### 3.2 Docker Compose and Deployment

- Optionally create separate docker-compose override files for development and production to avoid volume mounts in production.
- Automate deployment steps in CI/CD pipeline to replace manual deploy-windows.bat or call it from CI/CD.
- Use health checks and rolling updates if possible.

## 4. Dependent Files to Edit

- `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`
- Possibly `infrastructure/deploy-windows.bat` (optional)
- Possibly `infrastructure/docker-compose.yml` or add override files

## 5. Follow-up Steps

- Implement the CI/CD pipeline changes.
- Test pipeline on feature branches and main branch.
- Measure build and deploy times before and after.
- Adjust caching and conditional logic as needed.
- Document the new pipeline and deployment process.

---

This plan aims to optimize build and deploy times by leveraging smart dependency detection and caching in the CI/CD pipeline, enabling faster iteration and deployment cycles.

Please confirm if you approve this plan or want me to adjust or add anything.

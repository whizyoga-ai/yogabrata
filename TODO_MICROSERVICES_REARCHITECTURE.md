# Microservices Rearchitecture Plan

## Overview
Transform yogabrata-site from monolithic application into independent microservices architecture with each service having its own database, UI, and Agentic AI orchestration.

## Identified Microservices
Based on current agent structure:

1. **Startup Formation Service** - Complete business formation workflows
2. **Legal Compliance Service** - Legal compliance monitoring and audits
3. **Content Strategy Service** - Content creation and social media management
4. **Business Formation Service** - Core business registration logic
5. **API Gateway Service** - Centralized routing and authentication

## Architecture Goals
- Each microservice: Independent DB, UI, and core application
- Agentic AI orchestration using n8n.io workflow patterns
- Event-driven communication between services
- GitHub projects for each microservice under yogabrata-site organization

## Implementation Plan
- [ ] Create GitHub repositories for each microservice
- [ ] Set up microservice project structures
- [ ] Implement individual databases for each service
- [ ] Create independent UI applications for each service
- [ ] Implement Agentic AI orchestration for each service
- [ ] Set up API Gateway for service communication
- [ ] Configure Docker Compose for local development
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipelines for each service
- [ ] Implement service discovery and communication
- [ ] Add monitoring and logging for all services

## Next Steps
1. Create GitHub repositories structure
2. Set up individual microservice templates
3. Implement core service architecture
4. Configure inter-service communication
5. Set up development and deployment workflows
